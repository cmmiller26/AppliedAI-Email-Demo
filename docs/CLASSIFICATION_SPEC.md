# Email Classification Specification

## Overview

This document defines how emails are classified using OpenAI's GPT models. The system uses preset categories for the POC with an extensible design for future user-defined categories.

---

## Preset Categories (POC v0.1)

### 1. URGENT üî¥
**Description:** Time-sensitive emails requiring immediate attention.

**Characteristics:**
- Contains deadline language ("due today", "by 5pm", "urgent")
- Action verbs ("respond immediately", "confirm by")
- High-priority senders (professors with assignments, registration deadlines)

**Examples:**
- "Assignment due tonight at 11:59 PM"
- "Final exam location change - please confirm"
- "Action required: Financial aid deadline tomorrow"

---

### 2. ACADEMIC üìö
**Description:** Class-related emails including assignments, grades, lectures, and course materials.

**Characteristics:**
- From professors, TAs, or course management systems
- Contains course codes (CS 4980, MATH 2850)
- Keywords: assignment, exam, lecture, grade, syllabus, office hours

**Examples:**
- "CS 4980: Week 5 lecture notes posted"
- "Your midterm grade is available"
- "TA office hours rescheduled"

---

### 3. ADMINISTRATIVE üèõÔ∏è
**Description:** University business, registration, forms, official notices.

**Characteristics:**
- From university departments (Registrar, Bursar, Housing)
- Keywords: registration, enrollment, tuition, forms, policy, requirement
- Official tone and formatting

**Examples:**
- "Fall 2026 registration opens November 1"
- "Complete your housing application"
- "University policy update notification"

---

### 4. SOCIAL üéâ
**Description:** Events, club meetings, social gatherings, and community announcements.

**Characteristics:**

- Keywords: meeting, event, party, join us, RSVP, free food
- Casual, invitational tone

**Examples:**

- "Homecoming game watch party - free pizza!"
- "Join us for the career fair"

---

### 5. PROMOTIONAL üì¢
**Description:** Marketing emails, newsletters, announcements, and advertisements.

**Characteristics:**
- Bulk/mass email formatting
- Marketing language ("limited time", "don't miss out", "subscribe")
- From external organizations or campus marketing departments
- Contains unsubscribe links

**Examples:**
- "Student discount: 20% off textbooks"
- "Weekly campus newsletter"
- "Amazon Prime Student - Free 6 months"

---

### 6. OTHER üì¶
**Description:** Catch-all for emails that don't fit above categories.

**Characteristics:**
- Ambiguous content
- Low confidence in other categories

- Automated notifications

**Examples:**
- "Package delivery notification"
- "Password reset confirmation"
- Personal correspondence

## OpenAI Configuration

### Model Selection
```python
MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Cost-effective, fast, good accuracy
# Alternative: "gpt-4o" for higher accuracy (more expensive)
```

### Parameters
```python
{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "temperature": 0.3,      # Low temperature for consistent results
    "max_tokens": 200,        # Enough for JSON response
    "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}  # Force JSON output
}
```

**Why these settings:**
- **Temperature 0.3:** Reduces randomness, ensures consistent categorization
- **max_tokens 200:** Sufficient for category + confidence + reasoning
- **JSON mode:** Guarantees parseable response

## Prompt Template

### System Prompt
```
You are an email classification assistant for university students at the University of Iowa. 
Your job is to categorize emails to help students organize their inbox efficiently.

Classify each email into exactly ONE of these categories:
- URGENT: Time-sensitive, requires immediate action, has deadlines
- ACADEMIC: Classes, assignments, grades, lectures, professors, course materials
- ADMINISTRATIVE: Registration, forms, tuition, university business, official notices
- SOCIAL: Events, club meetings, social gatherings, RSVPs, campus activities
- PROMOTIONAL: Marketing, newsletters, advertisements, bulk emails
- OTHER: Everything else

Consider:
1. Sender domain (e.g., @uiowa.edu suggests ACADEMIC or ADMINISTRATIVE)
2. Keywords indicating urgency, deadlines, or time-sensitivity
3. Tone (official vs casual vs marketing)
4. Context clues in subject and body

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "category": "CATEGORY_NAME",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this category was chosen"
}
```

### User Prompt (Per Email)
```
Classify this email:

From: {from_address}
Subject: {subject}
Body Preview: {body_preview}

Received: {received_datetime}
```

**Input Processing:**
- `body_preview`: First 500 characters of email body
- Strip HTML tags: `<p>`, `<div>`, etc.
- Remove excessive whitespace and newlines
- Normalize encoding

## Implementation Details

### Function Signature
```python
def classify_email(
    subject: str,
    body: str,
    from_address: str,
    categories: list[str] = None,  # Future: user-defined categories
    model: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
) -> dict:
    """
    Classifies an email using OpenAI.
    
    Returns:
        {
            "category": str,
            "confidence": float,  # 0.0 to 1.0
            "reasoning": str
        }
    """
```

### Error Handling
```python
# If OpenAI API fails
{
    "category": "OTHER",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Classification failed - API error"
}

# If confidence < 0.5
{
    "category": "OTHER",
    "confidence": 0.35,
    "reasoning": "Low confidence - ambiguous email content"
}
```

### Fallback Rules (No AI Available)
Simple keyword matching as backup:
```python
FALLBACK_KEYWORDS = {
    "URGENT": ["urgent", "asap", "due today", "deadline", "immediately"],
    "ACADEMIC": ["assignment", "exam", "grade", "lecture", "professor"],
    "ADMINISTRATIVE": ["registration", "enroll", "tuition", "form"],
    "SOCIAL": ["meeting", "event", "rsvp", "join us"],
    "PROMOTIONAL": ["unsubscribe", "discount", "offer", "newsletter"]
}
```

---

## Cost Estimation (POC)

### OpenAI Pricing (gpt-4o-mini)
- Input: $0.15 / 1M tokens
- Output: $0.60 / 1M tokens

### Per Email Cost
- Average email: ~300 tokens input, ~50 tokens output
- Cost per email: **~$0.00006** (less than 1 cent per 100 emails)

### POC Budget
- 1,000 emails classified: **~$0.06**
- 10,000 emails: **~$0.60**

**Very cost-effective for testing!**

---

## Extensibility for Future Phases

### User-Defined Categories (Phase 2)
```python
def classify_email(
    subject: str,
    body: str,
    from_address: str,
    categories: list[str] = DEFAULT_CATEGORIES,  # User can override
    examples: dict[str, list[str]] = None  # Few-shot examples per category
):
    # Dynamically build prompt with user categories + examples
    pass
```

### AI-Suggested Categories (Phase 3)
```python
def analyze_inbox_patterns(emails: list[dict]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Analyze user's inbox and suggest natural categories.
    Uses clustering on email metadata (senders, keywords, frequency).
    """
    pass
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases
1. **Clear categorization** - Obvious category assignments
2. **Edge cases** - Ambiguous emails, multiple potential categories
3. **Spam/promotional** - Ensure marketing emails don't leak into other categories
4. **Urgency detection** - Deadline keywords correctly trigger URGENT
5. **Sender domain** - @uiowa.edu emails correctly categorized

### Sample Test Emails
```python
TEST_EMAILS = [
    {
        "subject": "CS 4980 Assignment due tonight",
        "from": "john-smith@uiowa.edu",
        "expected": "URGENT"
    },
    {
        "subject": "Applied AI meeting this Thursday",
        "from": "applied-ai@uiowa.edu",
        "expected": "SOCIAL"
    },
    {
        "subject": "20% off all textbooks this week!",
        "from": "bookstore@marketing.com",
        "expected": "PROMOTIONAL"
    }
]
```

## Performance Metrics

### Target Accuracy (POC)
- **>85%** correct categorization on test set
- **<5%** "OTHER" category usage (indicates good category coverage)
- **>0.7** average confidence score

### Monitoring
- Log all classifications with confidence scores
- Track category distribution over time
- Flag low-confidence classifications for manual review

## Future Improvements

1. **Multi-label classification** - Some emails fit multiple categories
2. **Priority scoring** - Within each category, rank by importance
3. **Smart folders** - Auto-move emails to Outlook folders based on category
4. **Learning from user feedback** - Improve classifications based on user corrections
